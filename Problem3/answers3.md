1. The interactive html element is brush (which we also classed x). And inside that we have background class. This class listens to any brushing event.
2. The name of the html element used for selection is extent. 
3. There are two other elements-- resize e and w (most likely stands for east and west). These are two edges of the extent class and can be used for extending the selection.
